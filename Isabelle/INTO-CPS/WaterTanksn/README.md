# INTO-CPS
This folder contains the Isabelle files that are required for the generation of CSPm, Alloy and Graph ML files to be executed by FDR3, Alloy 4, and the implementation of Johnson's algorithm in the JGraphT Java library.

The file generation can be started by running the file 'WaterTanksn_Generate.thy' in Isabelle.

The experiment can be run by importing the Java project 'JavaEval.zip' into Eclipse and then run
the programs that will execute the generated files using FDR3, Alloy, or Johnson's algorithm.
