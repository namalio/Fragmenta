A simple watch has a crown and one standard button:
* Initially, the watch shows the time. When the button is pressed, the watch shows the date; once released, the watch shows the time again.
* When the crown is pressed the light is turned on; once released, the light is turned off.
* Pressing twice the crown button calls the "set alarm" function allowing the alarm to be set.
* When the alarm is on a bell is shown.
