# FRAGMENTA
FRAGMENTA is a theory of modular model design that can be used to design DSLs whose structure is defined by metamodels. Fragmenta is, essentialy, a theory to design fragmented or modularised class models. Using FRAGMENTA, designers can break an overall model into pieces (called fragments) that can be put together to build meaningful wholes. This is in contrast with more classical MDE approaches that are essentially monolithic. The theory is based on an algebraic description of models and fragments based on graphs and morphisms.

FRAGMENTA is presented in the following paper:

* Nuno Am√°lio, Juan de Lara and Esther Guerra. FRAGMENTA: A Theory of Fragmentation for MDE. Models 2015.

This is the repository of FRAGMENTA. It includes:

* The complete Z specification of FRAGMENTA; under 'z-spec'
* The Isabelle files that define 'FRAGMENTA'; under 'Isabelle'
